Prompt:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Solution 1:
Concatenize each list to a number, add, seperate back into linked list

Solution 2:
Add each number as visited and add to a new linked list, keep track of any remainders
